# School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project

<h2>üìö Introduction</h2>
Welcome to my Cybersecurity Legal Compliance Simulation project! The aim of this is to provide a scenario involving a tech company named TechFite. The company has been caught up in criminal activities, our mission here is to dig into the story, figure out what might be going wrong, and then explore how important laws and rules in cybersecurity apply to the situation. Join me in this project to see how regulatory laws keep our digital spaces safe!

<h2>üóùÔ∏èüîß Key Components:</h2>

- <b>Case Study</b>: This section will explain the details of our case study, it will be a real-world scenario involving questionable business practices and potential legal violations within the company.
- <b>Investigation Mission</b>: This section is where we play the role of a digital detective, finding out the alleged criminal activities and applying cybersecurity laws, regulations, and legal theories.
- <b>Summary and Recommendations</b>: Then we would explore the findings and results gained from our investigation, make a detailed summary directed to senior management, and make recommendations that aim to fortify legal compliance and cybersecurity within the company.

<h2>üîëüí° Detailed exploration of each key component</h2>
Note: I've conveniently linked the necessary documents to their respective sections. To ensure a smooth flow, we'll begin by exploring the case study and unraveling the scenario we'll be using. Next, we'll move on to the solution section, where we address the identified problems. Finally, we'll wrap up with a comprehensive summary that ties everything together.
