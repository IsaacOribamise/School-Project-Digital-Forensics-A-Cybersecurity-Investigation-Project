# School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Hey there! In this hands-on project, I will be about digital forensics and how it plays a role in ensuring cybersecurity. For this project, we would use the Autopsy tool to investigate a suspected breach of company policy. It is a scenario-based project about the case of John Smith, a mechanical engineer at an oil company, suspected of unauthorized access to and dissemination of proprietary data. As a member of the investigative team, my role is to analyze digital evidence extracted from Mr. Smith's office laptop. The goal is to provide senior management with a comprehensive incident report, shedding light on potential policy violations and explaining the critical importance of cybersecurity measures in protecting organizational assets.

<h2>🛠️ Tools That I Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Lab Access</b>: Since this was a school project the virtual lab ass was provided by my school. 
- <b>Autopsy Software</b>: This is a digital forensics platform designed for analyzing and investigating digital evidence on storage devices. It is an open-source graphical interface that simplifies the process of conducting forensic examinations on various file systems. 



<h2>🔄💻 Required System Requirement: I use an HP ENVY x360 Laptop (Not the best but it does the job)</h2>

- <b>[🧠 CPU: 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1355U 1.70 GHz (Anything higher than this will work)]</b>
- <b>[💾 RAM: 16GB (gigabytes) of RAM (I will say 8 GB of RAM or higher will suffice)]</b>
- <b>[📀 Disk: 1TB (Terabyte) (500GB - 1000GB of free disk space will be enough)]</b>
- <b>[🔄 BIOS/UEFI: VT-x, AMD-V, or the equivalent must be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI]</b>
- <b>[🔧 System Type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor (⚠️MANDATORY: This is a must)]</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 1: Download and install VirtualBox from the official website. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 2: Download and exact all the other tools (Kali Linux, Windows server 2019, Windows 11 OS, and Metasploitable). Lastly, you can also put everything in a designated folder to make it look organized.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 3: We are going to create a VM for each tool. > Open VirtualBox and click on "New" to create a new virtual machine for each tool. Repeat the process for each tool. You can check out the video I linked above for a more detailed process</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 4: Connect VMs in a Network > In VirtualBox, select each VM and go to "Settings" > "Network." Choose the "Bridged Adapter" for each VM to connect them to the same network.</b>

- <b>📝 STEP 5: We explore and practice: As I said we are only setting up the Home lab and connecting each tool, then using it for future projects. So keep watch for the next project] </b>

<h2>💡 key lessons and takeaways from this project:</h2>
I laid the foundation for a secure and controlled environment where I can explore, learn, and experiment with various cybersecurity tools and techniques. Understanding how the virtual world works, understanding these tools, and the purpose they serve. So stay tuned for more exciting projects that lie ahead! 🌐💻🚀
