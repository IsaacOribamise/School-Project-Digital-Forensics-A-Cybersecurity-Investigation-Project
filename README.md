# School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Hey there! In this hands-on project, I will be about digital forensics and how it plays a role in ensuring cybersecurity. For this project, we would use the Autopsy tool to investigate a suspected breach of company policy. It is a scenario-based project about the case of John Smith, a mechanical engineer at an oil company, suspected of unauthorized access to and dissemination of proprietary data. As a member of the investigative team, my role is to analyze digital evidence extracted from Mr. Smith's office laptop. The goal is to provide senior management with a comprehensive incident report, shedding light on potential policy violations and explaining the critical importance of cybersecurity measures in protecting organizational assets.

<h2>🛠️ Tools That I Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Lab Access</b>: Since this was a school project a virtual lab with the autopsy software was provided by my school. 
- <b>Autopsy Software</b>: This is a digital forensics platform designed for analyzing and investigating digital evidence on storage devices. It is an open-source graphical interface that simplifies the process of conducting forensic examinations on various file systems. 

<h2>🔄💻 Project Highlights:</h2>

- <b>Utilizing Autopsy for in-depth analysis of digital evidence.</b>
- <b>Uncovering clues on John Smith's office laptop.</b>
- <b>Creating a comprehensive incident report for senior management.</b>


<h2> Step-by-step Guide on how this project will proceed.
In the first section, I will describe all the steps taken in the Autopsy software to create the forensic system case file. Provide screenshots of these steps to have a visual understanding of what I am doing.
  
- <b> 1: The first step that we would take is to open the Autopsy app and click on “New Case” to create a new case file.</b>

- <b>2: After the creation of a new case file, the next step is to fill in the case information for the new case file. First, by giving it a name (I named mine 'JohnSmith') and saved it in a directory which I saved in the Evidence file.</b>

- <b>3: Now that our new case file is set, we select a host based on our data source name and click 'Next' to proceed.</b>

- <b>📝 4: If everything was done correctly, this page would display meaning we are ready to analyze our data source. </b>

The second section is to then describe all steps taken in Autopsy to identify potential evidence, including data files, deleted data files, directories, or drive partitions.

- <b>📝 5:Now we begin analyzing the data sources for relevant evidence for our investigation. The first set of data that I discovered was the numerous amounts of images relating to the oil industry. </b>

- <b>📝 6:Then I discovered some relevant PDFs that could be used for the investigation. The title of the documents led to the suspicion that the employee was dealing in shady activities.  </b>

- <b>📝 7: Under deleted files, another set of documents that are relevant to our investigation was found. This 
means that the employee was trying to cover his tracks by getting rid of them.  I also found an email file that looks to be encrypted or obscured, preventing anyone from knowing the contents of the email. I believe the employee is hiding important information that could lead to solving this investigation</b>

<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/IsaacOribamise/School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project/assets/154943957/096b526c-89ff-435a-9bfb-6e177a7a940c">

In the last section, I will summarize the findings that I identified during your investigation and the conclusions I made regarding the suspect and the collected evidence.
Before I draw any conclusions, I want to prove for a fact that the evidence that I discovered does indeed, 
prove that the employee did violate the company’s policy.

- <b>📝 8: The documents found from the employee 'deleted files' are 100% proprietary data that he had no 
right or authorization to access them. Below are some examples of the proprietary data that were 
deleted.</b>
<img width="620" alt="image" src="https://github.com/IsaacOribamise/School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project/assets/154943957/30fc07bb-69e3-4539-a232-8c1261d60c79">
<img width="619" alt="image" src="https://github.com/IsaacOribamise/School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project/assets/154943957/b7b8db88-e626-4907-ad06-fd2407dcb7bf">
<img width="629" alt="image" src="https://github.com/IsaacOribamise/School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project/assets/154943957/afa32d0d-02b4-43fa-84a2-680d55646348">

- <b>📝 8: And it looks like he was trying to sell the proprietary data anonymously through the use of Bitcoin, 
which is another violation.</b>
<img width="750" alt="image" src="https://github.com/IsaacOribamise/School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project/assets/154943957/2df1c121-06e6-45bb-a269-1bd7dc0fa34d">

- <b>📝 9: Lastly, l extracted some of the documents relevant to the invesƟgaƟon for further analysis.</b>
<img width="749" alt="image" src="https://github.com/IsaacOribamise/School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project/assets/154943957/8421fb30-8ee2-4401-a1fe-570dc539c4cb">

To wrap this invesƟgaƟon up, the team and I compiled a detailed report of our findings and 
important evidence. The invesƟgaƟon of the employee’s computer image reveals facts and signs that he 
violated the company rules through unauthorized access to confidenƟal information. Additionally, the 
employee was looking into ways to make anonymous transacƟons using Bitcoin. This means he might 
have been trying to sell the company's confidenƟal documents. So, in conclusion, the employee did 
violate the company’s rules



<h2>💡 key lessons and takeaways from this project:</h2>
