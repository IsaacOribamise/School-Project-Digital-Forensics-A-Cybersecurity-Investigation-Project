# School-Project-Digital-Forensics-A-Cybersecurity-Investigation-Project

<h2>📚 Introduction</h2>
Hey there! In this hands-on project, I will be about digital forensics and how it plays a role in ensuring cybersecurity. For this project, we would use the Autopsy tool to investigate a suspected breach of company policy. It is a scenario-based project about the case of John Smith, a mechanical engineer at an oil company, suspected of unauthorized access to and dissemination of proprietary data. As a member of the investigative team, my role is to analyze digital evidence extracted from Mr. Smith's office laptop. The goal is to provide senior management with a comprehensive incident report, shedding light on potential policy violations and explaining the critical importance of cybersecurity measures in protecting organizational assets.

<h2>🛠️ Tools That I Used</h2>

- <b>Virtual Lab Access</b>: Since this was a school project a virtual lab with the autopsy software was provided by my school. 
- <b>Autopsy Software</b>: This is a digital forensics platform designed for analyzing and investigating digital evidence on storage devices. It is an open-source graphical interface that simplifies the process of conducting forensic examinations on various file systems. 

<h2>🔄💻 Project Highlights:</h2>

- <b>Utilizing Autopsy for in-depth analysis of digital evidence.</b>
- <b>Uncovering clues on John Smith's office laptop.</b>
- <b>Creating a comprehensive incident report for senior management.</b>


<h2> Step by Step Guide how this project went.

- <b> 1: The first step that we would take is to open the Autopsy app and click on “New Case” to create a new case file.</b>

- <b>2: After the creation of a new case file, the next step is to fill in the case information for the new case file. First, by giving it a name (I named mine 'JohnSmith') and saved it in a directory which I saved in the Evidence file.</b>

- <b>3: Now that our new case file is set, we select a host based on our data source name and click 'Next' to proceed.</b>

- <b>📝 5:Now we begin analyzing the data sources for relevant evidence for our investigation. The first set of data that I discovered was the numerous amounts of images relating to the oil industry. </b>

- <b>📝 6:Then I discovered some relevant PDFs that could be used for the investigation. The title of the documents led to the suspicion that the employee was dealing in shady activities.  </b>
